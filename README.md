# TrainTime

This is an app that allows a user to add to a schedule of trains by inputting a train name, destination, first train time and frequency.

Moment.js is then used to calculate the next arrival and minutes away, which are stored in a firebase database and will display to the
user when the page is initially loaded and which will add trains to the schedule and display in real-time to all visitors of the page when 
trains are added.
